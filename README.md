# DSGN-270-a5: Stephan's Harry Rosen Figma Prototype

## Design Concept Notes

- I kept the overall design with the floating frames and cards when adding the prototyping links, just did some adjustments.
- I also made the left hero image cycle through different images.
- The cards on the bottom I prototyped to have a horizontal scroll effect. I liked how this turned out a lot.

## Troubleshooting

- Today, March 20th I attempted to add additional prototyping pages by clicking the explore link on the sneakinshoes website. However, I was met with this error:
  - ![brokenLink](https://github.com/Stayl045/dsgn270-a5/blob/4b022e62b16c732230d3226b7eff090005a21a49/broken-link.png)
- I have no idea why the site is no longer available. Perhaps this brand is no longer a thing or the website is broken.
  - None the less, I instead went to the [Harry Rosen](https://www.harryrosen.com/en) website for inspiration. However, I did not like the look, so I kind of did my own thing for frames of 'shop' and 'explore'.
- I also noticed flaws with the cycling hero as it doesn't seem to transition as smooth as I would like it to. I was done with tweaking timing to make this look better. So I apologize for the look.
